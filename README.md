I have taken a challenge to make project on every algorithm of Machine Learning. [ Day - 14 | Stock Price Prediction using SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION]
"Day-14: Stock Price Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR) focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical data. In this project, we employ Support Vector Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to model the relationship between various factors like previous stock prices and other relevant features. SVR is particularly effective for handling non-linear data and can provide more accurate predictions compared to traditional linear models. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, and the implementation of SVR for stock price forecasting, offering valuable insights into the potential of machine learning in financial markets."
